`Title:
Sleep disturbances as a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review and meta-analysis

Review question:
Are sleep disturbances (insomnia, sleep fragmentation, obstructive sleep apnea, circadian disruption) associated with an increased risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in adults?

Objectives:
To systematically review and synthesize longitudinal evidence evaluating the association between sleep disturbances and incident MCI.

Eligibility criteria:
Population: Cognitively normal adults ≥50 years at baseline.
Exposure: Sleep disturbances (insomnia, poor sleep quality, OSA, sleep fragmentation, circadian rhythm disorders) assessed by PSG, actigraphy, or validated questionnaires.
Comparator: No sleep disturbance or normative sleep.
Outcome: Incident MCI (clinical diagnosis, Petersen criteria, MoCA<26, CDR 0.5).
Study designs: Prospective cohort and case-control studies.
Language: English.

Information sources and search strategy:
Databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science.
Grey literature: ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, conference proceedings.
Example PubMed string:
(("Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders"[Mesh] OR "Sleep Wake Disorders"[Mesh] OR insomnia[tiab] OR "sleep disturbance*"[tiab] OR "sleep fragmentation"[tiab] OR "circadian rhythm"[tiab] OR "sleep apnea"[tiab] OR OSA[tiab]) AND ("Mild Cognitive Impairment"[Mesh] OR "mild cognitive impairment"[tiab] OR MCI[tiab] OR "cognitive decline"[tiab]) AND (longitudinal[tiab] OR prospective[tiab] OR cohort[tiab]))

Data extraction:

Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort/case-control studies. Two reviewers independently assess; disagreements resolved by consensus.

Data synthesis:
Random-effects meta-analysis (DerSimonian-Laird or REML) pooling HR/RR/OR. Subgroup analyses by sleep disturbance type, objective vs subjective measures, sex, and region. Sensitivity analyses excluding high-bias studies. Publication bias assessed with funnel plots and Egger test.

To synthesize evidence linking sleep disturbance with amyloid, tau, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration markers in MCI.

Eligibility:
Studies of adults with MCI assessing sleep and any biomarker modality (CSF, PET, plasma, MRI).

Information sources:
PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CENTRAL.

Synthesis:
Narrative by biomarker type; meta-analysis for pooled effect sizes where sufficient homogeneous data exist.`

`Title:
Validity and predictive value of consumer wearables and smartphone sleep tracking in mild cognitive impairment populations: a systematic review

Review question:
How accurate are consumer wearables in measuring sleep compared to PSG/actigraphy in older adults/MCI, and do wearable-derived metrics predict cognitive decline?

Objectives:
1) Assess validity of consumer wearables vs PSG/actigraphy in older adults/MCI.
2) Summarize prospective associations between wearable sleep metrics and cognitive outcomes in MCI.

Eligibility:
Validation and longitudinal studies involving consumer devices in MCI/older adult populations.

Sources:
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, conference proceedings.

Synthesis:
Pooling validation metrics where feasible; narrative summary of predictive evidence.`

`Title:
Cross-cultural differences in sleep practices and associations with mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review

Review question:
How do cultural and regional sleep practices influence the prevalence or risk of MCI?

Objectives:
To summarize evidence from diverse geographic regions on associations between culturally patterned sleep behaviors and MCI.

Eligibility:
Studies from any region reporting sleep habits linked to cognitive outcomes in older adults.

Sources:
PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, regional databases (e.g., IMEMR), grey literature.

Synthesis:
Narrative synthesis with possible meta-analysis for comparable prevalence data; highlight measurement and translation issues.`
