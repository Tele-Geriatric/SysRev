  <br>Here's a research plan for that topic.
 <br>Sleep and Mild Cognitive Impairment Research 
<b>Research Websites</b>
  <ul>
  <il>(1) Analyze the fundamental relationship between sleep patterns and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to provide both a concise overview and a comprehensive explanation of the established links.
</il><il>(2) Investigate the current scientific literature to identify specific mechanisms, pathways, and contributing factors that link sleep disturbances to the development or progression of MCI.
</il><il>(3) Evaluate existing systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and recent research articles on sleep and MCI to identify at least ten distinct research gaps or unanswered questions that warrant further investigation, particularly those suitable for an International Medical Graduate (IMG) to explore.
</il><il>(4) Based on the identified research gaps, formulate at least ten distinct and answerable systematic review questions related to sleep and MCI.
</il><il>(5) For each formulated systematic review question, develop comprehensive search strategies for both PubMed and Embase databases, including relevant MeSH/Emtree terms, keywords, and appropriate Boolean operators, ensuring separate strategies for each database.
</il><il>(6) For each systematic review question, design a detailed data extraction template in a table format, including standard columns such as author, year, sample size, methods, population, sleep measures, cognitive outcomes, results, confounders, and risk of bias, and populate it with at least two rows of mock data.
</il><il>(7) For each systematic review question, create a risk of bias summary table template, including standard domains (e.g., selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias) and populate it with mock ratings to illustrate its structure.
</il><il>(8) Synthesize all the gathered information into a single structured document, including a background section on the sleep and MCI link, a section on research opportunities, the developed search strategies for PubMed and Embase, the data extraction table with mock data, and the risk of bias table with mock examples.
  </ul>
